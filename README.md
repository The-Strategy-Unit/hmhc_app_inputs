# hmhc_app_inputs


## Activity data inputs
Fetch activity data for the three main acute hospital settings (ED, APC and OPC)
from SUS tables in NCDR. Aggregate data by sex, single year of age, local authority
and point of deliveryâ€”POD groups are referred to as 'hsagrps'. Data is for a single
calendar year, for patients aged 18+ resident in England. Upper age group is set to 90+.

## Population data inputs
Mid-year population estimates, national population projections (NPP) and sub-national population projections (SNPP)
Also, life tables published alongside the NPP and estimates of the very old and centernarians 

`read_life_tables_2018b.r`
`read_npp_2018b.r`
`read_pop_mye.r`
`read_snpp_2018b.r`
`read_very_old.r`


## Other inputs
Administrative geographies change maintain list of local authority districts, ICBS, countys

`read_geog_codes.r`
`read_icb_lookup.r`

## Health Status adjustment inputs
`data/split_normal_parameters.csv`
derived from notebook

## 90+ in pyramid
## sub-national variants

## Modeling
* for each hsagrp/sex  in each area:
* baseline and horizon
* pick projection variant
* Model the relationship between age and activity by sex, by 'hsagrp' in each area.
Generalised additive models (GAMs) are created to smooth/generalise the relationship
in baseline year - act rates
* Health status adjusted ages derived from exercise for ages 55-90 so each combination
of age/sex has a chroniclaoal age and a HSA age uncertainty associated with estimate of
HSA which is generated from a distribution in horizon year - we run the model n times
sampling a different value from distribution each time
* gnerate new activity rate for hsa by using gams to predict or interpolating (immaterial for speed)
* compare new predicted rate with basline rates (assumed to be from gam remove random fluctation might be good year predict bettter)
ratio is taken as a multiplier
* calculate demo multiplier - chnage in projected population
* multipley hsa multiplier by demo multiplier then multiply activity in basleine to get estimate of activity in horizon year (x100 mdoel runs)
* calcy % change in activity this is shown in app
